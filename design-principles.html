                <p class="descriptions">Honda uses the rule of thirds on their website by splitting the images and links
                    up in thirds. For
                    example, the Honda Go picture of the motorcycle has us focus on the 2 thirds of the motorcycle
                    picture
                    and the last third on the Honda Go logo.</p>

            <p class="descriptions">MGM Resorts uses Fitt's Law by making the main buttons easily accessible for the
                user. The main focus on
                the site is setting the date for when you want to book your stay. If you could scroll down lower in the
                website you will see paragraphs that say "learn more" which make it easy for users to click on.</p>
