            <p>The target audience will mainly appeal to adults from the age 21 and beyond and for both genders. That
                live in the state of Arizona or are planning to visit Arizona.

            <h3>Two Personas</h3>
            <p>Jackie Blue: She is someone who lives in Tombstone, Arizona but has family in Mesa, Arizona and Storm
                Center, Arizona. She likes to
                check that the weather is nice for her and her family and likes to make sure there is nothing bad going
                on around her area or her families.</p>
            <p>David Springer: He is from Missouri looking to fly to Arizona. He likes to check the weather and plan
                what it will be like a week out. In addition, he likes to check to see what is nearby or what to do
                during the week he'll be out.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Scenarios</h3>
            <p>Jackie notices clouds are forming in the sky in the middle of dead winter. She hops on the site to check
                what the weather will be like for her town in Tombstone. She hops on the site and the first thing she
                sees is a map with the highs and lows for all of Arizona. She is able to pinpoint her location and
                figure out that she may be receiving rain in her area. She decides to click on her location and it
                reveals some news or events near or surronding her.</p>
            <p>David wants to visit Storm Center, Arizona and wants to know the weather. He checks the weather by
                clicking on the navbar link for Storm Center. In it he sees the weekly weather forecast and events
                nearby. He clicks on one of the events and reads about this event.</p>
            <p>Jackie is at Walmart and overheard people talking about the heavy rains outside just now. She also, saw
                other patrons walking in with umbrellas and wet clothes. She hops on her phone and searches up Beyond
                the Weather. She sees that her area is experiencing heavy showers and an article about a recent car
                crash.</p>
            <p>David is minutes before boarding the plane from Missouri to Arizona. He pulls out his phone and opens up
                the website. He wants to see if there were any events in Soda Springs. He clicks the button for Soda
                Sprints and gets the weather for today and events happening nearby. He clicks on the weather and is able
                to scroll to view the entire week.</p>
            <p>Jackie has lost power in her area due to thunderstorm. She cannot view the website on her computer so she
                uses her phone. When she is on the website she sees there is a alert saying the power is out. She clicks
                on the alert and learns that in her town, a tree fell on top of a telephone pole and caused a shortage.
                She also sees that tomorrow there should be heavy showers as well.</p>
