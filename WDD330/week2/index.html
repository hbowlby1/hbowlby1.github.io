    <h2>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, 2nd Edition</h2>
    <h3>Chapter 2 Notes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>var was replaced with let due to scoping issues. It's better to use let and const.</li>
        <li>Variables with an underscore at the beginning are usually private variables.</li>
        <li>putting $ at the beginning is usually associated with jquery</li>
        <li>startsWith() is a method you can use to check if the string starts with a certain character. It is case sensitive.</li>
        <li>You can use typeOf() is determine the primitive value. It cannot distinguish between integers and floats. You can use isInteger() for that.</li>
        <li>toFixed(x) will round up the last number indicated by the parathenses.</li>
        <li>null behaves like zero but undefined is NaN</li>
        <li>Always use hard equality (===)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Chapter 3 Notes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>join() is used to turn items in an array into a string. Whatever is in the parathenses is what seperates them.</li>
        <li>You can use reverse() on arrays to reverse the items in it. It changes the order permanently.</li>
        <li>sets were introduced in ES6 and acts like an array but any number that repeates only appears once.</li>
        <li>rest of the chapter after this is review.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h3>Chapter 4 Notes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>arrow functions are always anonymous so you have to assign them to a variable.</li>
        <li>arrow functions are very versatile and sometimes better because they are easier to read, require only one line and the return statement is applied.</li>
        <li>function hoisting is where you place the function before it has been defined.</li>
    </ul>
