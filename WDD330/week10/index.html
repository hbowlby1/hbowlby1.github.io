    <h2>Client Side Form Validations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>client side validation is one of the first steps in preventing users from entering wrong information</li>
        <li>However, it is not a form of security, data being passed to a server should also have server side validation
            (refer to your phpmotors database in CSE340 class).</li>
        <li>There are two different forms of validation. HTML5 (what I'm used to) and JavaScript validation.</li>
        <li>example of form validation with CSS elements <a href="fruit-start.html">here</a></li>
        <li>another example that includes min, max, datalist, patterns and more <a
                href="https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/html/forms/form-validation/full-example.html">here</a></li>
        <li>Most of everything else is review and is something I am currently working on or have worked on personally, previously or currently.</li>

    <h2>Using Fetch</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>disclaimer, this as well is review for me. I'll add information that I may not know.</li>
        <li>I've used the fetch() api in multiple classes and the best example I have is my weather app. <a href="https://hbowlby1.github.io/WDD230/lesson-11/index.html"> here</a></li>
        <li>in my opinion the fastest and easiest way to implement the fetch api is via copying and pasting.</li>
    </ul>
