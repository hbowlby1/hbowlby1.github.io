    <h2>Chapter 10: Testing and Debugging</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>exceptions returns a value which you can use program an error.</li>
        <li>stack traces are a group of errors.</li>
        <li>warnings are errors in the code but do not prevent the project from running and compiling.</li>
        <li><code>'use strict';</code> is a statement added at the top of the file that can be used to detect errors and classify sloppy code as errors.</li>
        <li>it does not need to be at the top of the file but can be used as a "as needed" basis. For instance, inside functions.</li>
        <li>we can use <code>alert()</code> as breakpoints in the code because it stops the code until "OK" is clicked.</li>
        <li>you can use <code>console.log()</code> as well but just know it does not stop the code.</li>
        <li>you can use web browsers like chrome to troubleshoot code. For instance <code>debugger</code> can be placed in functions to show what varibles contain and so forth.</li>
        <li>make sure to remove <code>debugger</code> from the code before production otherwise the program will appear to freeze.</li>
        <li>You can use try and catch methods (something you are already familiar on).</li>
        <li>You can use test frameworks like <a href="https://jestjs.io/">jest</a> to test your code.</li>
    </ul>
