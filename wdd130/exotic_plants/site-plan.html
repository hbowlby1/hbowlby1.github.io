        Open Sans would make a great heading font because it is easy to read it

        Same with roboto, in fact they contrast with each other very well.
        Roboto, at least for me, feels very smooth on the eyes and I know my
        readers will feel the same way.

        that we have acquired through the years and from our own experience.

      <h3>What Are Exotic Plants</h3>
      <p>
        Exotic plants are not your standard kind of plant. These could be
        flowers, fruits or vegetables that you usually do not purchase at
        grocery. In fact, you may need to go a specialty market for these kinds
        of plants. You may already be familiar with them, for example you have a
        standard Gros Michel banana or the most common found in grocery stores,
        the cavendish. However, there are different varieties of bananas, like
        the “Truly Tiny” which is a 3-foot banana tree that produces tiny edible
        bananas, the Musa Basjoo which is cold hearty (we’ll learn more about
        this later) banana plant that can grow up to 20 feet or more. Or you
        have everyone’s favorite (or one you are just learning about) the blue
        java banana which is variety that grows blue bananas before they ripen
        to yellow. Outside of bananas you have lychees, rambutans, kiwano,
        guanabana (soursop), papaya, passion fruit, star fruit, bird of
        paradise, hibiscus and so many more. Most listed are fruiting plants but
        most bear unbelievable colored flowers. I recommending searching up
        exotic plants in Google and going crazy. In fact, you may discover a
        nursery near you that sells these plants. Just make sure you know your
        hardiness zone (we’ll learn more about that later) so you now how you
        can grow it in your area.
      </p>
      <h3>Hardiness Zones</h3>
      <p>
        The USDA has 26 different hardiness zones (1-13a and 1-13b) all across
        the US and Puerto Rico. However, most of the time on the plants tag it
        will just list a number between 1-13, so you do not need to worry about
        a or b. Essentially a hardiness zone is what your minimum temperament is
        in the area that you live in. For example, up north like North Dakota
        ranges from 2-4 on the hardiness scale. Meaning the lowest temperature,
        it will get is between -45 and -25 F (-45.6 and -28.9 C). Then you have
        areas like Hawaii that between 25-70+ F (-3.9-21.1 C) depending on which
        island you live on. The USDA Hardiness Zone does not take into account
        humidity levels and how much light per day each state gets.
      </p>
      <h3>Gardening Basics</h3>
      <p>
        Taking care of exotic plants is almost similar to every other plants.
        Some will require lots of water, sunlight and fertilizer and others will
        need practically none. The very first thing you should always research
        is your Hardiness Zone and your soil type. This can be done through a
        simple google search on your zip code hardiness zone and “what plants
        grow well in my city”? After that, you can start gathering the materials
        that you will need. The top three is space, light and water. If you do
        not have access to that you may need to look into ways on obtaining
        these. If it’s light, you should be able to buy grow lights on Amazon or
        your nearest nursery. If it’s water, you could stock up on 5-gallon
        bottles or fill large water drums. Unless you are lucky enough to live
        in an area where water is abundant through weather, I’m looking at you
        Florida and Hawaii. Space is usually the hardest to get, but luckily you
        can grow pretty much anything inside in a raised pot or any kind of pot
        for this matter. Before purchasing any kind of exotic plant, put as much
        research as you can on the subject. The internet and books are pretty
        scattered on this information so I recommend using this site, local
        nursery and Reddit. In person is usually best because they will give you
        the best advice. After, you have done your research you can purchase
        your plant. Depending on what you researched you will learn how
        important watering is. I don’t mean to scare you but water is both the
        nectar of plant life and reaper of all exotic plants. In fact, watering
        will be the hardest part as you will need to determine what is best for
        your plant. Overwatering can rot your root system and underwatering that
        shrivel your root system. The general rule of thumb for exotic plants is
        making sure that the top soil is a little dark and moist to touch. Next
        thing you will learn about is the kind of soil you’ll need. From what
        I’ve learned most exotic plants like fast draining soil so your best
        friend will be cactus or palm soil. But again, go based on your
        research. As for the space, always go based on how tall your plant could
        get. 1-2 feet might do fine in a 12-inch pot, 3-4 feet might be best in
        24-inch pot and anything above 5 feet would do best inground or in a
        large pot (24+ inches). You will also learn that some exotic plants love
        all sun, partial sun (also known as shaded) or completely shaded from
        the sun. You can learn more about specific plants on this website, feel
        free to browse.
