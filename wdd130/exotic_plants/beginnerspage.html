          What Are Exotic Plants
        </h3>
        <p>
          Exotic plants are not your standard kind of plant. These could be
          flowers, fruits or vegetables that you usually do not purchase at
          grocery. In fact, you may need to go a specialty market for these
          kinds of plants. You may already be familiar with them, for example
          you have a standard Gros Michel banana or the most common found in
          grocery stores, the cavendish. However, there are different varieties
          of bananas, like the “Truly Tiny” which is a 3-foot banana tree that
          produces tiny edible bananas, the Musa Basjoo which is cold hearty
          (we’ll learn more about this later) banana plant that can grow up to
          20 feet or more. Or you have everyone’s favorite (or one you are just
          learning about) the blue java banana which is variety that grows blue
          bananas before they ripen to yellow. Outside of bananas you have
          lychees, rambutans, kiwano, guanabana (soursop), papaya, passion
          fruit, star fruit, bird of paradise, hibiscus and so many more. Most
          listed are fruiting plants but most bear unbelievable colored flowers.
          I recommending searching up exotic plants in Google and going crazy.
          In fact, you may discover a nursery near you that sells these plants.
          Just make sure you know your hardiness zone (we’ll learn more about
          that later) so you now how you can grow it in your area.

        <h3>
          Hardiness Zones
        </h3>
        <p>
          The USDA has 26 different hardiness zones (1-13a and 1-13b) all across
          the US and Puerto Rico. However, most of the time on the plants tag it
          will just list a number between 1-13, so you do not need to worry
          about a or b. Essentially a hardiness zone is what your minimum
          temperament is in the area that you live in. For example, up north
          like North Dakota ranges from 2-4 on the hardiness scale. Meaning the
          lowest temperature, it will get is between -45 and -25 F (-45.6 and
          -28.9 C). Then you have areas like Hawaii that between 25-70+ F
          (-3.9-21.1 C) depending on which island you live on. The USDA
          Hardiness Zone does not take into account humidity levels and how much
          light per day each state gets.

        <h3>
          Gardening Basics
        </h3>
        <p>
          Taking care of exotic plants is almost similar to every other plants.
          Some will require lots of water, sunlight and fertilizer and others
          will need practically none. The very first thing you should always
          research is your Hardiness Zone and your soil type. This can be done
          through a simple google search on your zip code hardiness zone and
          “what plants grow well in my city”? After that, you can start
          gathering the materials that you will need. The top three is space,
          light and water. If you do not have access to that you may need to
          look into ways on obtaining these. If it’s light, you should be able
          to buy grow lights on Amazon or your nearest nursery. If it’s water,
          you could stock up on 5-gallon bottles or fill large water drums.
          Unless you are lucky enough to live in an area where water is abundant
          through weather, I’m looking at you Florida and Hawaii. Space is
          usually the hardest to get, but luckily you can grow pretty much
          anything inside in a raised pot or any kind of pot for this matter.
          Before purchasing any kind of exotic plant, put as much research as
          you can on the subject. The internet and books are pretty scattered on
          this information so I recommend using this site, local nursery and
          Reddit. In person is usually best because they will give you the best
          advice. After, you have done your research you can purchase your
          plant. Depending on what you researched you will learn how important
          watering is. I don’t mean to scare you but water is both the nectar of
          plant life and reaper of all exotic plants. In fact, watering will be
          the hardest part as you will need to determine what is best for your
          plant. Overwatering can rot your root system and underwatering that
          shrivel your root system. The general rule of thumb for exotic plants
          is making sure that the top soil is a little dark and moist to touch.
          Next thing you will learn about is the kind of soil you’ll need. From
          what I’ve learned most exotic plants like fast draining soil so your
          best friend will be cactus or palm soil. But again, go based on your
          research. As for the space, always go based on how tall your plant
          could get. 1-2 feet might do fine in a 12-inch pot, 3-4 feet might be
          best in 24-inch pot and anything above 5 feet would do best inground
          or in a large pot (24+ inches). You will also learn that some exotic
          plants love all sun, partial sun (also known as shaded) or completely
          shaded from the sun. You can learn more about specific plants on this
          website, feel free to browse.
