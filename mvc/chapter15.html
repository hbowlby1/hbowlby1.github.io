    <h2>Chapter 10: Testing and Debugging</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Using a library like jQuery can reduce the amount of line and code to type.</li>
        <li>Libraries can cause the website to load slower due to having to download the file with it. But today, this
            can be resolved by gziping or using a server sided connection.</li>
        <li>Libraries are useful for getting mundane tasks done but can sometimes lead to sloppy code.</li>
        <li>You can use modules to break up code in seperate files. You can use the keyword <code>export</code> to allow
            the class, variable or object outside of the file.</li>
        <li>Just make sure to call the import statement like so: <code>import { PI } from './pi.js';</code></li>
        <li>you can also use <code>import * as stats from './stats.js';</code> much like in SQL the star (*) calls all
            of the exported items.</li>
        <li>you cannot have more than one default export statement.</li>
        <li>using default exports means you do not need to add curly brackets when importing.</li>
        <li>MVC (model view controller) is another way to organize code. The model is the set up of how everything is
            stored. The view is the display and the controller controls the input and outputs. Sometimes the controller
            is included in the view when working with JavaScript.</li>

        <li><a href="https://todomvc.com/">This may prove useful for the ToDo project</a></li>
        <li>View libraries are another way of organizing code. You can use React and vue.js.</li>
        <li><code>NPM</code> can be used to grab libraries or nodes to be used in a project. <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">check out the website</a></li>
        <li>You can minify JavaScript files, so that way you only need one script tag in HTML</li>
        <li>Minification usually removes all whitespace and comments and put the code on one line.</li>
        <li>File organization is another way of organization</li>
    </ul>
